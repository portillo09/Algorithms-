I started with asking for user input to input any list of integers. I created a start, a center and an end. The program starts in the center of the array and looks at the left first. It cuts the left into twos until you reach the base case. Once it is done with finding the max product of the left, it recursively calls itself and starts at center +1 and finishes at the end to find the max product of the right side. Once the program has found the max left and max right we compare the left with the right and then see if the left multiplied by the right is the biggest. Now the program has successfully found the max subsequence product.
